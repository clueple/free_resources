00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,033
In this video 

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:04,500
we'll learn the 3 basic steps on building apps 

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,833
We call it 'ADD' 

4
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,500
appearance, details, and debug 

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,200
Here 

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,033
we'll use the simple YouTube Downloader app as an example 

7
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,632
First of all, we'll deal with the look 

8
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:19,300
That'll be handled in the layout section 

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,532
You're very lucky 

10
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,900
coz you can download a ready-to-view template on Github 

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,300
If you wanna dig deep on how to do it 

12
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:30,432
feel free to watch the episode 2 and 3 

13
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,799
Once you've designed the app's layout 

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,867
you need to fill in the details 

15
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:38,267
In our YouTube Downloader app 

16
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,632
there're 2 basic functions 

17
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:43,433
You can refer to episode 3 and 4 

18
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:46,533
if you wanna know in-and-out how we do this 

19
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,933
Throughout the process 

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,633
you'll for sure encounter errors 

21
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,499
That's the tedious part of debugging 

22
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,999
That's episode 5 and 6 

23
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:56,933
Finally 

24
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:01,100
you'll learn how to convert the finished script to an actual app
